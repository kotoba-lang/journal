(ns journal.core
  "An append-only EDN transaction journal.

  The durable half of `langchain.db`'s persistence port: `create-conn`
  replays a journal to rebuild its in-memory index, and every subsequent
  `transact!` appends one line. Restarting reads the same history back.

      (require '[journal.core :as journal]
               '[journal.fs :as journal.fs]
               '[langchain.db :as db]
               '[langchain.persist :as persist])

      (let [j (journal/journal (journal.fs/file-io \"decisions.journal.edn\"))]
        (db/create-conn schema (persist/scoped j :authn.decisions)))

  `journal` returns the host event-log operation map
  `{:append (fn [stream event]) :read (fn [stream since])}` that
  `langchain.persist/scoped` binds to one stream, so this namespace needs no
  dependency on langchain -- or on any storage model. The backing sink is an
  injected `io` map (see `journal.fs`), which is the whole host seam:

      {:read-text    (fn [] text-or-nil)
       :append-text! (fn [text])}

  ## Format

  One EDN map per line, appended and never rewritten -- the same shape the
  rest of this workspace's append-only ledgers use, so `git log -p` on a
  journal reads as a list of what happened rather than a diff of a rewritten
  blob. Each line is the event its producer appended plus the stream it
  belongs to:

      {:journal/stream :authn.decisions :tx 1 :tx-data [[:db/add 1 :a \"v\"]]}

  File order is transaction order; no sequence number is stamped, so an
  append never has to read what is already there.

  ## What append-only costs

  A journal keeps every value it was ever given, including ones a later
  transaction retracts -- retraction removes a fact from the index, not from
  the history. That is the point for an audit ledger and the wrong shape for
  secrets: do not journal a store whose delete has to actually erase (see
  `authenticator`'s vault, which stays a rewritten snapshot for exactly this
  reason)."
